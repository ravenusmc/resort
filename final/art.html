          <a href="assets/images/art/napoleon.jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/art/napoleon.jpg" alt='Painting of Napoleon'>
          </a>
          <p class='art_paragraph'>This painting, from the very start of the 19th century, leaves me with a sense that Napoleon, who was at his height of his power, was ready to take on all of Europe. It shows the dictator ready to take on any challenge. However, for me, it is more than that. This painting symbolizes the confidence of one European man to take on any challenge. Europe would also have to eventually take on this individual which meant that the other side would also have to produce great men to do it. Thus, Europe was ready to take on the 19th century and anything that would be thrown at it.

          <a href="assets/images/art/mountain.jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/art/mountain.jpg" alt='Mountain Image'>
          </a>
            <p class='art_paragraph'>This painting is from the Romantic era in Europe. It was painted towards the start of the 19th century. I believe that when one looks at this painting you can get one of two feelings. The first is that the man on top of the mountain has conquered a great climb and ready for his next challenge. Europe, in the 19th century was on top of the world. I would argue that the people in Europe specifically in the more modern states such as Great Britain and France felt that they could conquer anything. The other feeling that one could get is that even though this man is on top of the mountain, he is uncertain about the future which is represented by the fog. Parts of Europe had recently become industralized and there were a lot of changes occuring within society. People were moving from the country side into the cities. All of this would lead to great political and economic changes.

          <a href="assets/images/art/picasso.jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/art/picasso.jpg" alt='Picasso Painting'>
          </a>
           <p class='art_paragraph'>This Picasso painting, in many ways, demonstrates that something is changing in Europe and around the world. The painting shows five nude women who are painted with sharp angles-who appear almost as if they are deformed. This is not a normal painting that one would expect. It is almost as if Picasso is tapping into some secret aspect of the universe and knows that in a few short years all of Europe will be shattered with World War One. Empires will come crumbling down and the old order(s) will fade away.

          <a href="assets/images/art/dix.jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/art/dix.jpg" alt='Otto Dix WW One Painting'>
          </a>
            <p class='art_paragraph'>Painted about fourteen years after World War one, the painting truly shows the horror of the war. Gone are the powerful, majestic scenes from the 19th centry. Europe was essentially destroyed by the war. (What was not fully destroyed would be by the end of World War 2.) Otto Dix was a German who fought on the front lines for most of the war. His artwork captures the horror of it. In many aspecs, his work would capture a lot of the horrors of the 20th century. It is almost as if the fog from the Wanderer above the sea of fog has retreated and what is left is nothing but horror and war. When looking at this painting, I truly feel as Europe has lost its soul at this point. It has become a monster.

            <img src='assets/images/art/terminal.jpg' alt='People falling from the Twin Towers'>
          </a>
          <p class='art_paragraph'>Not a painting but a series of photographs from 9-11. The 21st century started out with the terrorist attack on 9-11. However, this event was not the only event to define the 20th. The World Wide Web had gone mainstream a few years earlier. Computers were now common place in the home allowing the individual to have access to tremoundous amounts of information. The series of photo's, in this artwork, were created by using technology. The artist, Carolee Shneeman, used technology to zoom in on the same individuals falling from the towers. This piece may not have bene possible if the towers were destroyed just 20 years earlier. Thus, technology is not only bringing humans together but technology may also be the very tool that eventually destroys us. So far, in 2017, it appears that technology and its impact on humanit will be a major theme throughout the 21st century.
