    <dl>
      <dt>What is the point of this site?</dt>
        <br>
          <dd>This site is the final project for my web development class at Gwinnet Tech.
          However, I have a background in history, political science and I love the Humanities. So, I decided to build a site that would have a humanities aspect to it. At the same time, I am also a tutor for history so this site will be able to advertise my skills to others.</dd>
        <br>
      <dt>May one actually order tutoring services from the site?</dt>
        <br> 
          <dd>At this current time, there is actually no real way to order tutoring services from the site. The e-commerce portion of this site does not actually allow you to place any real orders. It is all simulated.</dd>
        <br>
      <dt>Is the information on the site accurate?</dt>
        <br>
          <dd>All of the information found on this site is accurate and is backed up by a thorough bibliography-which one may look at the link for that page <a class='fix_underline' href='biblio.html'>here.</a> I guess you can say that in many ways I gave myself extra work ensuring that all of the information was accurate!</dd>
        <br>
      <dt>What will the books link show me?</dt>
        <br>
          <dd>The books page is recommendation of books that the user on the site may use to expand on the topics that this site presents.</dd>
