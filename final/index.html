            <h4>The Battle of Teutoburg Forest</h4>
            <p>On this page you will learn about a battle between the Roman and Germanic forces in 9 A.D. Although many people have never heard of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest it was a battle where the Romans were defeated by Germanic tribes. Because of this, Rome never expanded past the Rhine River. Thus, Germany was never latinized which may have set the course of European History for 2000 years...

          <br>
            <dd class='about_paragraph '>This site is the final project for my web development class at Gwinnet Tech.
            However, I have a background in history, political science and I love the Humanities. So, I decided to build a site that would have a humanities aspect to it. At the same time, I am also a tutor for history so this site will be able to advertise my skills to others.</dd>

        <h2 class='center contact_title title_font about_title'>About Me</h2>

        <p class='about_paragraph'>I have two BA's in History and Political Science from the University of California at Davis and a master's degree in International Relations from Webster University.</p>

        <p class='about_paragraph'>In the spring of 2015, I chose to take a leap in a new direction and immerse myself in learning full stack web development. I attended the coding bootcamp Tech Talent South to invest serious time and effort toward my new passion and jump start my journey toward becoming a full stack web developer. My casual interest in web development has now become a guiding passion and I am excited to bring that passion to my next pursuit.</p>

        <p class='about_paragraph'>The experience I have earned in the Marine Corps and C.I.A. has awarded me confidence and ability to accomplish tasks in a timely manner. I am a strong leader with well developed and proven organizational, problem solving, analytical and time management skills. Comfortable with technical and non-technical people on all levels of an organization. I look forward to bringing my ambition and passion for knowledge and my past professional work experience in team-oriented environments.</p>

        <p class='about_paragraph'>Finally, I have fully immersed myself in the Atlanta tech community attending meetups, conferences as well as hackathons to grow as a developer. I continue to learn by staying up to date with latest languages and technologies that will help me achieve those goals.</p>

      <p class='center contact_paragraph'>I hope that you enjoyed looking through my site. More importantly, I hoped that you learned something. The purpose of this site was to show you that I have a love of history. However, I believe that history is not just dates and facts. It is real stories that have huge implications for people. A battle, in the distant path, may have repurcussions to the present day. Art illustrates the popular themes of the day but also provides a record into the human soul when it was made.</p>

      <p class='center contact_paragraph'>I hope that you contact me to be a tutor. I would love to share more of my knowledge with you. All you have to do is fill out a simple form and click the submit button...</p>
