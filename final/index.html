      <!-- HTML for Question and Answer parts of the website --> 
      <dl>
        <dt>What is the point of this site?</dt>
          <br>
            <dd>This site is the final project for my web development class at Gwinnet Tech.
            However, I have a background in history, political science and I love the Humanities. So, I decided to build a site that would have a humanities aspect to it. At the same time, I am also a tutor for history so this site will be able to advertise my skills to others.</dd>
          <br>
        <dt>May one actually order tutoring services from the site?</dt>
          <br> 
            <dd>At this current time, there is actually no real way to order tutoring services from the site. The e-commerce portion of this site does not actually allow you to place any real orders. It is all simulated.</dd>
          <br>
        <dt>Is the information on the site accurate?</dt>
          <br>
            <dd>All of the information found on this site is accurate and is backed up by a thorough bibliography-which one may look at the link for that page <a class='fix_underline' href='biblio.html'>here.</a> I guess you can say that in many ways I gave myself extra work ensuring that all of the information was accurate!</dd>
          <br>
        <dt>What will the books link show me?</dt>
          <br>
            <dd>The books page is recommendation of books that the user on the site may use to expand on the topics that this site presents.</dd>

    <section id='about_section'>
      <h2 class='center sub_heading'>About Me</h2>

      <p class='about_paragraph'>I have two BA's in History and Political Science from the University of California at Davis.</p>

      <p class='about_paragraph'>Earlier this year, I chose to take a leap in a new direction and immerse myself in learning full stack web development. I attended the coding bootcamp Tech Talent South to invest serious time and effort toward my new passion and jump start my journey toward becoming a full stack web developer. My casual interest in web development has now become a guiding passion and I am excited to bring that passion to my next pursuit.</p>

      <p class='about_paragraph'>The experience I have earned in the Marine Corps and C.I.A. has awarded me confidence and ability to accomplish tasks in a timely manner. I am a strong leader with well developed and proven organizational, problem solving, analytical and time management skills. Comfortable with technical and non-technical people on all levels of an organization. I look forward to bringing my ambition and passion for knowledge and my past professional work experience in team-oriented environments.</p>

      <p class='about_paragraph'>Finally, I have fully immersed myself in the Atlanta tech community attending meetups, conferences as well as hackathons to grow as a developer. I continue to learn by staying up to date with latest languages and technologies that will help me achieve those goals.</p>
