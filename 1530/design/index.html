      <div class='descr_area'>
        <p>Having a background in logistics, I immediately thought of the FedEx logo. If one turns their attention to the E and the X one can see the use of negative space, i.e. <span>Negative Space/closure</span>, to create an arrow. By simply using the empty space on the lower half of the E and on the left hand of the X, FedEx has created a simple but great logo. Which signals to the user that they are going places or on the move!</p>

      <div class='descr_area'>
        <p>This next image uses the <span>proximity</span> of the ties to create a sense that there are three individuals standing before you as a group. I do not believe that this logo would have worked as well if the ties were further apart. They also use the top portion of the tie to make it appear as if the ties are also three cats.</p>

        <h1>Image Three</h1>
      </div>
      <div class='descr_area'>
        <p>The Olympic symbol uses the <span>repetition</span> design principle. Repetition, according to our text, helps to tie a design together. In this case, using the rings over and over again creates the symbol for the Oympics. The  rings are also all different colors which signifies to me bringing in people from all over the world. However, I'm not 100% sure why they choose the ring to repeat over and over again. Maybe because of gymnastics?</p>
